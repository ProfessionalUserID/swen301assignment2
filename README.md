DISCUSSION:
    For this assignment I chose the Jackson library. I have used this library in a previous assignment
    so using a library that I already have prior experience in has made this assignment a lot more
    streamlined for me. Jackson is also known to have a high level of performance which makes it a good
    choice even if I hadn't used it in a previous assignment. Throughout this assignment it seemed like
    Jackson has a pretty large developer base as finding answers to questions was always quick and easy.
    I also knew of a quite a few fellow students that chose the Jackson library so it seemed like a safe
    bet in terms of finding help both online and from my peers.
